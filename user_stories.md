# User Stories — Hotdog Upsell Predictor

| ID | As a... | I want to... | So that... | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|----------|---------------|-------------|----------------------|
| US1 | Learner | set up my Jupyter environment easily | I can start coding without dependency issues | Package installs run cleanly and verify MLflow version. |
| US2 | Learner | practise TDD on a simple rule | I understand the Red → Green → Refactor cycle | Function passes both positive and negative tests. |
| US3 | Learner | log experiments safely | I can reproduce and inspect my results later | MLflow block completes or skips gracefully. |
| US4 | Learner | refactor code safely | I don’t break existing functionality | All tests remain green after refactor. |
| US5 | Learner | debug a failing test systematically | I can identify root causes rather than guessing | Follow Reproduce → Isolate → Fix → Verify process. |
| US6 | Learner | understand professional Git workflow | I can simulate real-world version control | Markdown commit log shows meaningful, atomic commits. |
| US7 | Learner | extend my code with a promo policy | I can handle evolving business logic | New tests for promo flag pass; existing behaviour unchanged. |
| US8 | Coach | review learner notebooks efficiently | I can confirm understanding and identify gaps | Notebook includes clear headings, working tests, and reflection. |

**Epic:** Develop disciplined coding and testing habits for production-grade ML systems.
