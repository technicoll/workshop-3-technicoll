## Expected outputs
You've done a lot of work. In a real project, this work would be done as a series of commits on a feature branch.

## Step 6 – Git Simulation & Reflection

**Cell 8 – Simulated commit log**

```python
print("### My Commit Log")
commits = [
    "feat: Add initial failing test for lunch loyalty",
    "fix: Implement lunch loyalty rule",
    "feat: Add evening loyalty test",
    "fix: Handle time-of-day logic",
    "refactor: Simplify function and add docstring",
    "fix: Add busy heatwave override"
]
for c in commits: print("-", c)
```

**Cell 9 - Markdown reflection cell:**

    ### Reflection
    - What technical debt did you remove today?  
    - How did tests act as your safety net?  
    - Which step felt most like professional engineering?
