# User Brief — Hotdog Upsell Predictor

## Project Title
**Upsell Like an Engineer**

## Background
Busy food outlets often want to know whether to offer customers a drink with their order.  
This workshop reframes that simple logic as an engineering exercise to teach:
- Test-Driven Development  
- Refactoring and readability  
- Safe logging with MLflow  

The exercise demonstrates how small, clear tests and defensive coding habits reduce risk in AI projects.

## Objectives
- Implement a minimal decision logic function (`should_upsell`) using **TDD**.  
- Record experiments using **MLflow**.  
- Refactor safely using tests as a safety net. 

## Deliverables
1. Completed master notebook (`Workshop3W_Master.ipynb`)  
2. Logged experiment (`./mlruns/`) 

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass in the notebook.
- Code follows refactor rules (readable, modular, documented).  
- MLflow logging runs without error or fails gracefully.  
- Learner can explain each rule and its precedence.

## Timeframe
- **Main Workshop:** 1 day (6 hours)
